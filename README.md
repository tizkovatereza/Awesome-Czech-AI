  <summary><b>Prague on Luma</b> - Initiative to get Prague listed on Luma's event platform.</summary>
    &nbsp;
  
  - Luma, a go-to online place for AI and tech events, doesn't currently list Prague. All the other "cool kids" are there - London (67 events a month), Berlin (36 events a month), New York (53 events a month)...
  - Cities are listed based on how many events are hosted there (based on my knowledge).
  - We need more Prague events registered on Luma to get the city listed
  - Consider hosting your next AI event through Luma to increase Prague's visibility
  - Here is how you add your event on Luma:
    - https://lu.ma/create
    - Once you have the event, you can feature it on existing Luma calendars, either based on category, topic, or city: https://lu.ma/discover. That will also help other people discover your event.
    - You can also start a Luma calendar for your organization or community: https://lu.ma/create-calendar. People can subscribe to it and get notified about upcoming events.
